# IoT-Based-ECG-Monitoring-with-AD8232-ECG-Sensor-ESP32

By leveraging the Internet of Things (IoT), we can create a more accessible, efficient, and real-time system for ECG monitoring. This Project explores how the AD8232 sensor captures heart signals, how the ESP8266 enables wireless communication, and how these components together revolutionize the way we monitor heart health remotely.
